# USB-POWERED-ESP32-PROGRAMMER
USB SELF-POWERED CONFIGURATION ESP32 PROGRAMMER


## Purpose:

This schematic demonstrates a USB self-powered configuration for programming an ESP32 microcontroller. The circuit uses the CP2102 USB-to-UART bridge IC to provide a serial interface for programming the ESP32.

## Components:

- CP2102: This IC converts USB signals to serial UART signals, allowing communication with the ESP32.
- ESP32: The target microcontroller to be programmed.
- Resistors: These components set the voltage levels and current limits for the circuit.
- Capacitors: These components filter the input and output voltages, as well as provide stability to the circuit.
- USB Type-C connector: This connector provides power and data communication to the circuit.

## Operation:

Power Supply: The circuit can be powered in two ways:

- USB Self-Powered: The circuit draws power directly from the USB bus. This is the recommended configuration for most applications.
- USB Bus-Powered: The circuit draws power from the ESP32's 3V3 pin. This configuration is not recommended for most applications as it can lead to unstable power supply.

## Programming: To program the ESP32, connect the following pins:

- TXD: Connect to the ESP32's RX pin.
- RXD: Connect to the ESP32's TX pin.
- GND: Connect to the ESP32's GND pin.

## Programming Software: 

Use suitable programming software like ESP-IDF or Arduino IDE to program the ESP32.

## Applications:

Programming ESP32 microcontrollers: This circuit is ideal for programming ESP32-based projects.
